## Quiz 3
- the evolution of the system is extremely sensitive to initial conditions. 
- You cannot conclude anything about the direction of the velocity of the bus.
- 18 N
  - consider Rope 1, lower block and Rope 2 as a whole. a = 2.3 $m/s^2$ and the forces on them are total gravity 1.5kg*g and the tension we want to find. Use Newton's second law. 
- Just at the instant when the projectile is being launched.
- Less than the weight of A plus the weight of B.
  
# Oscillation, non-inertia FOR, Kinetic Energy
## Oscillation
$$ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -b\frac{dx}{dt} - kx + F_0cos\omega_{dr}t$$
- be familiar with the solutions
### Harmonic Oscillation 
you need to know how to calculate

e.g. for a seesaw, can you calculate its natural frequency? Given initial condition, can specify its position, velocity, acceleration after 5 s?
### Damped Oscillation
- Be familiar with the solutions, be able to visualize any damped oscillation given initial condition
- e.g. How many times will an oscillator pass the equilibrium position? (Non --initial condition?; one time --initial condition?)
### Forced Oscillation
> The complete solution to a forced oscillation has two parts. $\tilde{x} = \tilde{x_i} e^{-\beta t} + \tilde{x_s}$. The first part depends on initial condition and decays exponentially w.r.t time. Here we only consider the stable part, the situation where the system had started for a long long time and first part decay to 0. $\tilde{x_s}$ depends on the system only and has nothing to do with initial condition. 
- what's resonance frequency? (memorize resonance frequency)
  - Amplitude reach peak
  - phase difference is $\pi/2$
- Have two graphs in mind:
  - Amplitude w.r.t drive frequency
  - phase shift w.r.t drive frequency

## Non-inertial FOR
Consider fictitious forces one by one. 
- d'Alembert force (translation acceleration)
- Euler force (angular acceleration)
- Coriolis force  (地转偏向力)
- centrifugal force （离心力）
Add fictitious forces to every component and analysis as usual. 
> gravity on earth is similar to fictitious forces. They're often considered together. e.g. You can consider a free drop box as a inertial FOR with no gravity. 

## Mechanical Energy
- Kinetic energy: translation and rotational (will discuss later)
- potential energy: 
  - gravitational
  - elastic
  - electric
  - etc. 

Generally speaking, energy transforms by forces doing work. In dynamics, mechanical energy is conservative unless some of them become heat, through dynamical friction for example. Always have a big picture of where the energy goes to, through which force and when.
